# Script to modify master.json for a g-speak release and a new os,
# and to sort the builders for each project alphabetically.
# Does not really parse json, just knows how master.json is usually laid out.
#
# Assumes you already have dev builders for the g-speak and os,
# and want rel builders for the new ones, and to update the dev builders.
# FIXME: control this with options, not hardcoded variables,
# and add options to handle new cef versions, etc.
#
# Usage:
#   vi master-json-tool.pl (and tweak vars)
#   perl master-json-tool.pl < g-speak/master.json > new.json
#   mv new.json g-speak/master.json
#
# Some assembly required.  Do not use while operating heavy machinery.

# Set variables to describe the current latest versions.
# (Skipping this section means the script just sorts builders sections.)
